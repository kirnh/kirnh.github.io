title: "My path to Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree"
---

The nanodegree program begins today (or tonight, depending on time zones), and I couldn’t be more excited. But before diving in, I’d like to reflect on the journey that brought me here.

To be completely honest, I'm still not entirely sure how I ended up in this place. When I began my bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering back in 2012, I was uncertain about my path. Despite having some background in electronics from college, I struggled to grasp the significance of the field. It felt like I lacked the experience necessary to make such a critical decision at that time. My discomfort with electronics might have stemmed from exposure issues, but whatever the reason, I knew I had to explore something different.

That’s when I turned to Mechanical Engineering. The tangible significance of mechanical systems intrigued me, and I wanted to delve deeper. Automotive Engineering, in particular, captivated me—I was absolutely fascinated by how internal combustion engines worked. For a while, I envisioned myself studying IC engines after college. But as I came to realize that IC engines were not only polluting but also on the verge of obsolescence (thanks to electric motors), I decided to drop that plan. I knew I couldn’t dedicate myself to something I wasn’t truly passionate about, so I continued searching for something that resonated with me.

Then, I discovered Data Science. The idea of predicting the future by analyzing past data made perfect sense to me. In a way, it mirrors what we, as animals, do instinctively—we constantly assess and react to our surroundings, even when we're unaware of how our brains accomplish this. Our brains are remarkable, and it was my curiosity about how they work that led me to Artificial Intelligence, which was creating quite a buzz in the tech industry. Lacking experience in programming, I decided to familiarize myself with Python and completed a nanodegree in data analysis. I hoped it would pave the way to AI and give me a better understanding of data science.

The course provided a brief yet insightful introduction to the various techniques and methods involved in data analysis. However, I realized that to truly grasp the nuances of technology, I needed hands-on experience with specific projects. Then, I stumbled upon the ‘Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.’ The moment I saw the syllabus, I knew it was a golden opportunity to immerse myself in Artificial Intelligence. The chance to work alongside others who are striving to transform an entire industry was too good to pass up.

And that’s what brings me here today, brimming with excitement to learn how a nervous system for cars is being invented.
