This is sort of an experimental setup under the light of documenting parts of my life. For now, majority of the content towards filling this space will come from a course I’m about to begin in two days called ‘Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree’ by Udacity.  However, I might also put in a few random thoughts that need some kind of form. In the most abstract way, I’d like to think of this blog as an attempt at documenting my time and space.
